# Rdnetto-Overlay

[![Repoman](https://travis-ci.org/rdnetto/rdnetto-overlay.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rdnetto/rdnetto-overlay)

This is an overlay for use with Gentoo. It contains packages intended for my personal use. Packages will be maintained on a best-effort basis, though caveat emptor.
Where possible, most packages have tooling in place that will automatically update them as part of my system updates, so this should hopefully be more up-to-date than most other overlays.

## Installing

    $ sudo layman -f -a rdnetto-overlay
